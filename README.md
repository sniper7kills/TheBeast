Documentation for Personal PC Build

## Objectives

This PC was built to meet the following objectives:

- [] Streaming // Media Creation abilities
  - [] Editing Videos
  - [] Live Streaming on Twitch
  - [] Video Capture of other VM's
- [] Gaming
- [] Cyber Secutiy
  - [] Lab Environment
  - [] Linux Distro Install
- [] MacOS

Due to the vast difference in the different objectives, and the need to have multiple running at the same time I decided to go for a fully virtuallized desktop environment.
